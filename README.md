An AI-powered web app that improves typing skills tailored typing exercises. A user first types one of our original (AI generated) prompts. The user receives feedback: words per minute, missed characters, accuracy %, etc.. After the initial run, the user receives a tailor made new prompt based on their inaccuracies, aiming to improve on their specific errors. This project won first place at the University of Delaware's HenHacks 2024 - Best Educational Technology Hack.

This tool, called the College Cost Analyzer, provides a Return-On-Investment (ROI) analysis for the completion of a bachelor's degree in a given major at a United States college. Simply enter the school and major to get a bar chart that compares the average cost of attendance for 4 years with the average salary for graduates of that major as well as a table that shows how many years it will take to pay off the cost of attendance depending on the percentage of salary set aside.
