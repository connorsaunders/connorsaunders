This tool, called the College Cost Analyzer, provides a Return-On-Investment (ROI) analysis for the completion of a bachelor's degree in a given major at a United States college. Simply enter the school and major to get a bar chart that compares the average cost of attendance for 4 years with the average salary for graduates of that major as well as a table that shows how many years it will take to pay off the cost of attendance depending on the percentage of salary set aside.
