An AI-powered web app that improves typing skills through real-time feedback and tailored typing exercises. A user first types one of our original (AI generated) prompts. The user receives feedback: words per minute, missed characters, accuracy %, etc.. After the initial run, the user receives a tailor made new prompt based on their inaccuracies, aiming to improve on their specific errors. This project won first place at the University of Delaware's HenHacks 2024 - Best Educational Technology Hack.
